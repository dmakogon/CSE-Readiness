<!-- Here is where the Pillar leads can put in the main goals/principles of the Pillar -->

## Operating Principles

We strive for a community that encourages learning through collaboration, including cross-pillar collaboration. We also learn through direct code-with opportunities with leading customers and ISVs in the data space.

This includes upskilling and evangelizing common use cases and architectural patterns.

We collaborate on open source projects, user stories, and whitepapers. And we share our learnings externally with the development community.

Our learnings influence product improvements through partner feedback, as well as direct collaboration with product teams.

## Pillar Mission

*Enable our engineers and program managers to understand strengths and trade-offs of various data technologies, to implement best-fit solutions.*
